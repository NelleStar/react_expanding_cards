Day 2 of 100 days of code challenge - react project 1. I am recreating the VanillaJS/CSS/HTML project I did for day 1 in React using state and components. 

The way I styled it is EXACTLY the same but needed some modifications since it works slightly differently in React. onClick events handle the user interactions and maps over the data.js file to create the panels. My next goal with this project is to handle multiple sections from the user in case they would like to look at 2 or more panels at once.

We return a container and so long as the data.length is more than 0 (to handle edge cases, however in this instance we know we have 5 items) we map each item with a className, a inline style of the photo url to be the background image, using the id as the key, and putting the onClick on the item. This map also makes an h3 for the name and a div for the info.
